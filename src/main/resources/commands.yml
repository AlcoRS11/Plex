#
# Command Blocker
#
# Format:
#   - "<regex or match>:<rank>:command name no slash:Block message"
#
# Symbols to use:
#   - r for RegEx
#   - m for matching
#   - The ranks are "e" for everyone, "s" for senior admin, and "a" for admin
#   - MATCHING MODE: The command is just the command without slashes. Optional arguments are specified as well. It also accepts full plugins via specifying the plugin name followed by a ":" (e.g. "viaversion:")
#   - REGEX MODE: The command is regex that matches the desired command. It matches case insensitively.
#   - Finally the block message. MUST NOT CONTAIN ":". Use _ to use the default command blocked message as specified in messages.yml, or you can optionally put your own in
#
# So these would be valid:
#   - "m:e:mail sendall:You cannot send messages to everyone on the server"
#   - "r:e:(.*:):Plugin specific commands are disabled"
