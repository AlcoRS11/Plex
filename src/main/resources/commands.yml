# Plex Command Blocking File
# For documentation, please visit: https://plex.us.org

# Format:
#   - "<regex or match>:<rank>:command name no slash:Block message"
#
# Symbols to use:
#   - r for RegEx
#   - m for matching
#   - The ranks are "e" for everyone, "a" for admin and "s" for senior admin
#   - The command is just the command without slashes. Optional arguments are specified as well
#   - Finally the block message. MUST NOT CONTAIN ":". Use _ to use the default command blocked message as specified in messages.yml, or you can optionally put your own in
#
# So these would be valid:
#   - "m:e:mail sendall:You cannot send messages to everyone on the server"
#   - "r:e:(.*:):Plugin specific commands are disabled"

commands: # Regexes and commands can't contain ';'. Don't try, commands can't contain ';' by default.
  - "r;(^\w+:);"Plugin specific commands are disabled
  - 'm;e;mail sendall;You cannot send messages to everyone on the server'
